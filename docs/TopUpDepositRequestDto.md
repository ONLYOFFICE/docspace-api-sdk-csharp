# DocSpace.API.SDK.Model.TopUpDepositRequestDto
How much money is charged to the payment method on file and added to the portal wallet.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Amount** | **int** | The sum to charge, as a whole number of units of `currency` - 10 means ten dollars and not ten cents. The  bounds are what one call may move, not what the wallet may hold, so a larger top-up is made of several calls. | [optional] 
**Currency** | **string** | The currency the charge is made in, as an ISO 4217 code in upper case. It has to be one of the accounting  currencies this installation supports, which `GET api/2.0/portal/payment/accounting/currencies` lists; any  other code is refused with 400. The money lands on the wallet sub-account of that currency, so topping up in  a second currency does not add to the first one. | [optional]
