# **SendOwnerChangeInstructions**
> OwnerChangeInstructionsWrapper SendOwnerChangeInstructions (OwnerIdSettingsRequestDto? ownerIdSettingsRequestDto = null)

Starts handing this portal over to another of its members: the confirmation letter goes to the current owner's  address, and nothing changes until the link in it is used. The owner's own email address has to be confirmed  first, otherwise the call is answered with 400; `GET api/2.0/people/@self` reports it as `activationStatus`.  The caller needs the portal-settings right of a DocSpace administrator, so a room administrator, an ordinary  member or a guest is refused with 403, as is naming a guest in `ownerId`. Only the portal owner can actually  start a transfer: an administrator who is not the owner, or a named user who is inactive or unknown here, gets  200 with `status` 0 and a localized refusal instead of an error, so read `status` and not the HTTP code. A  started transfer answers `status` 1 and a `message` carrying the owner's address inside an HTML `mailto:`  anchor rather than as plain text. Ownership itself does not move here; every call issues a fresh link usable  for a limited period, seven days by default, and the attempt is recorded in the audit trail. Complete the  transfer with `PUT api/2.0/settings/owner`; changing what a member may do is `PUT api/2.0/people/type/{type}`.

# **UpdatePortalOwner**
> void UpdatePortalOwner (OwnerIdSettingsRequestDto? ownerIdSettingsRequestDto = null)

Completes the portal owner change that `POST api/2.0/settings/owner` started, making the user named in  `ownerId` the owner of this portal. Authorization comes from the confirmation link in that letter, not from an  ordinary session: pass the link's `type`, `key`, `uid` and `encemail` parameters in the `confirm` request  header, and check with `POST api/2.0/authentication/confirm` that it is still usable, because it expires after  a limited period, seven days by default. A caller without such a link is refused whatever role it holds, and  so is a link whose address is no longer the owner's, which is what replaying a used link looks like. The named  user has to be an active member of the portal and must not be a guest. The call is mutating: a named user who  is not a DocSpace administrator yet is promoted to one first, and a promotion needing a paid seat the portal  lacks is refused before ownership moves. The previous owner keeps their account and role but loses the owner's  rights, and the change reaches the audit trail. The answer carries no payload: read the new `ownerId` from  `GET api/2.0/settings`, which needs no token. Only the new owner can start another transfer.
