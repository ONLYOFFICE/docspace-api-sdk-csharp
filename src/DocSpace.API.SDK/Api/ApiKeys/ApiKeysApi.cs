Read it before `POST api/2.0/keys` or `PUT api/2.0/keys/{keyId}`, because any other value is rejected with  400.  Any portal member except a guest may call it, and the call is read-only.  The answer is a flat list sorted alphabetically, holding the per-area scopes such as `accounts:read`,  `files:write` and `rooms:write`, the portal-wide `*:read` and `*:write`, and `*` which stands for a key  without scope restrictions.  The list is fixed for the portal and identical for every caller, so it can be cached by the client.
