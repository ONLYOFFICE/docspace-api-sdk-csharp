The caller needs the portal-settings right and is refused  without it; the call is read-only and idempotent. The number is added up from the storage counters the portal  keeps per owner, which means content that belongs to no account - system data - is not part of it, and it is a  plain number, not an object. The counters are maintained as files are written and removed, so the value is  current but may lag a large operation that is still running. The allowance to compare it with is  `maxTotalSize` from `GET api/2.0/portal/quota`, in bytes rather than gigabytes, and the smallest quota that  would still fit the portal is suggested by `GET api/2.0/portal/quota/right`. This operation says nothing about  which room or user the space belongs to - the per-user figures come from the People API.

The number is added up from the storage counters the portal  keeps per owner, which means content that belongs to no account - system data - is not part of it, and it is a  plain number, not an object. The counters are maintained as files are written and removed, so the value is  current but may lag a large operation that is still running. The allowance to compare it with is  `maxTotalSize` from `GET api/2.0/portal/quota`, in bytes rather than gigabytes, and the smallest quota that  would still fit the portal is suggested by `GET api/2.0/portal/quota/right`. This operation says nothing about  which room or user the space belongs to - the per-user figures come from the People API.
