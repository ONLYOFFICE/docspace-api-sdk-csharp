Any signed-in  user may call it for their own account and nothing has to be called first; the same clean-up for somebody else  is `PUT api/2.0/security/activeconnections/logoutall/{userId}`. The call is mutating and destructive for  sessions - every token and cookie issued to the user before it stops working and the clients holding them are  disconnected - and it is not idempotent: the request is written to the portal audit trail, which invalidates  the link any earlier call returned, and the caller's own client is handed a fresh cookie in the response and  stays signed in through a new connection. The password itself is not changed here, and the link is handed back  to the caller rather than mailed to the user: the URL carries a time-limited `PasswordChange` key, which the  confirmation page it opens - or `PUT api/2.0/people/{userid}/password` - needs to accept the new password. A  failure is swallowed instead of reported, so an empty body with status 200 means nothing was done and the call  has to be repeated.

Any signed-in  user may call it for their own account and nothing has to be called first; the same clean-up for somebody else  is `PUT api/2.0/security/activeconnections/logoutall/{userId}`. The call is mutating and destructive for  sessions - every token and cookie issued to the user before it stops working and the clients holding them are  disconnected - and it is not idempotent: the request is written to the portal audit trail, which invalidates  the link any earlier call returned, and the caller's own client is handed a fresh cookie in the response and  stays signed in through a new connection. The password itself is not changed here, and the link is handed back  to the caller rather than mailed to the user: the URL carries a time-limited `PasswordChange` key, which the  confirmation page it opens - or `PUT api/2.0/people/{userid}/password` - needs to accept the new password. A  failure is swallowed instead of reported, so an empty body with status 200 means nothing was done and the call  has to be repeated.
