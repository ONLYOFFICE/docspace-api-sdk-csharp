The  report covers the period reaching from now back by the login history lifetime that  `GET api/2.0/security/audit/settings/lifetime` reports and is never filtered: the query parameters of  `GET api/2.0/security/audit/login/filter` do not apply here. The caller needs the portal-settings right of a  DocSpace administrator plus the audit option of the portal's pricing plan, otherwise the call is answered with  402. The file is not ready when the response arrives - poll `GET api/2.0/security/audit/login/report` until  `isCompleted` is true, then take `resultFileUrl`, and treat a non-empty `error` as a failed build. The  finished file is saved to the caller's My documents section, as an XLSX workbook by default or as CSV when  `format=Csv`, in which case `resultFileId` stays empty and only the name and the URL identify it. One job runs  per caller and kind: calling again while the previous one is still building returns that job instead of  starting a second, and `DELETE api/2.0/security/audit/login/report` cancels it.
