Read the outcome from the body rather than the status code - an empty string means the license is now  active, and any other string is a message explaining why it is not: no license key was found, the key is not  correct, the installed edition does not match the license type, or the license is expired or too small for the  current user count. The acceptance stamp survives a failed activation, so a corrected file needs nothing  extra. An installation with no license path configured answers that its pricing plan does not support the  option and changes nothing. The operation stays reachable while the portal is unpaid.

The file is validated but not  put in force here - follow with `POST api/2.0/settings/license/accept` to activate it, and until then the  portal keeps the license it already had. The caller must be a DocSpace administrator, or hold a wizard or  administrator confirmation link while the setup wizard is still unfinished; after the wizard is complete such  a link alone is refused. An earlier staged file is overwritten, so the upload can be repeated safely. The  answer is a localized sentence, not a structured result: `Uploaded successfully` on its own, or the same words  plus the date since when support and updates are not covered, because a file already past its due date is  still accepted. A request carrying no file, and a license whose start date has not arrived yet, are rejected  as invalid; a file that cannot be read as a license, carries no customer id or signature, or was issued for  the other edition fails the call. Whether the editing service accepts it is only checked at activation.
