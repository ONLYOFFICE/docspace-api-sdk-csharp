The call is destructive and cannot be undone: the state  and the settings stored for the plugin are dropped along with its files, the domains its manifest declares are  taken out of the portal Content Security Policy, and the connected clients are notified. Getting the plugin  back means uploading its package again with `POST api/2.0/settings/webplugins`, and the settings it had are  gone. Nothing is returned on success, and a repeated call on a name that is no longer installed is rejected as  not found instead of answered as success. To keep a plugin installed but inactive, switch it off with  `PUT api/2.0/settings/webplugins/{name}` instead.

A portal  holds up to 100 plugins by default, the manifest name has to be lower-case letters, digits, `_`, `.` or `-`,  and the package is rejected when another installed plugin registers the same JavaScript object under a  different name.

An installation-wide plugin, the one whose `system` field is  true, can be removed on standalone installations only. The call is destructive and cannot be undone: the state  and the settings stored for the plugin are dropped along with its files, the domains its manifest declares are  taken out of the portal Content Security Policy, and the connected clients are notified. Getting the plugin  back means uploading its package again with `POST api/2.0/settings/webplugins`, and the settings it had are  gone. Nothing is returned on success, and a repeated call on a name that is no longer installed is rejected as  not found instead of answered as success. To keep a plugin installed but inactive, switch it off with  `PUT api/2.0/settings/webplugins/{name}` instead.
