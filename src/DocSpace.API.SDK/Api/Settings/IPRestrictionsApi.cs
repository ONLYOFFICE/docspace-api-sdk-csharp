        /// Stores the enforcement flag of the IP restrictions of the current portal together with the whole address list,  replacing the addresses saved before; this operation and `PUT api/2.0/settings/iprestrictions` are two routes  to the same handler and behave identically. The caller needs the portal-settings right of a DocSpace  administrator, otherwise the call is refused. Every entry must be a single IPv4 or IPv6 address: `from-to`  ranges and CIDR blocks are matched by the portal but cannot be stored here and are rejected as an invalid  request, as is `enable: true` with an empty list. An omitted `enable` follows the list - on when addresses are  sent, off when the list is empty - so the flag cannot be moved without resending the addresses that stay in  force. The new state applies to new requests without a restart, is recorded in the audit trail, and sending  the same body twice changes nothing further. Enforcement spares the portal owner and the installation's own  networks only, so a list without the caller's own address locks the remaining administrators out. The answer  echoes the request, so read the stored entries and their IDs with `GET api/2.0/settings/iprestrictions`.

        /// Replaces the whole IP restriction list of the current portal with the addresses from the request and stores  the enforcement flag in the same call. The caller needs the portal-settings right of a DocSpace administrator,  otherwise the call is refused. Every entry must be a single IPv4 or IPv6 address: `from-to` ranges and CIDR  blocks are matched by the portal but cannot be stored here and are rejected as an invalid request, as is  `enable: true` with an empty list. An omitted `enable` follows the list - on when addresses are sent, off when  the list is empty. The replacement is written in one transaction, applies to new requests without a restart  and is recorded in the audit trail; entries not repeated in the body are deleted, and sending the same body  twice leaves the portal as it is. Enforcement spares the portal owner and the installation's own networks  only, so a list without the caller's own address locks the remaining administrators out. The answer echoes the  request rather than the stored rows - no entry IDs, and `enable` exactly as sent, empty when it was omitted -  so read the result with `GET api/2.0/settings/iprestrictions`.
