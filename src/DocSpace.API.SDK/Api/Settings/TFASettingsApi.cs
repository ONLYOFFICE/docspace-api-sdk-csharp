Use it once the  previous codes have been spent or may have leaked: the whole old set stops being accepted the moment this call  succeeds, so store the new codes before leaving the response. Any authenticated member may call it, always for  their own account. The authenticator method has to be enabled on the portal and an application has to be  linked to the account already, otherwise the call answers 405, and accounts flagged as outsiders are refused.  The call mutates state and is not idempotent: every invocation issues another set and discards the one before  it, so a retry after a timeout returns codes different from those the first attempt generated. The codes come  back unused, five of them of six characters with the default configuration, and a portal may be configured for  a different number and length. Read the current set without changing it through  `GET api/2.0/settings/tfaappcodes`. The authenticator secret itself is untouched, so the linked application  keeps working.
