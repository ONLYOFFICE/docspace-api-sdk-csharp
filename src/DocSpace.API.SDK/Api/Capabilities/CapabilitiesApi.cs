No token is needed and nothing has to be called  first - the operation is open to unauthenticated callers, answers even while the portal's payment has lapsed,  and is read-only and idempotent. `providers` holds provider keys such as `google` or `facebook`, ordered for  the country detected from the caller's IP address and reduced to the ones this installation has configured;  pass one of them as `provider` to `POST api/2.0/authentication`. An empty `providers` means external sign-in  is off and an empty `ssoUrl` means single sign-on is off; a capability whose settings cannot be read is  reported as disabled rather than failing the call, so a false flag means the method is not offered, not that  it is unknown. The answer describes the portal and never a user, and carries none of the configuration behind  these methods: an administrator reads that from `GET api/2.0/settings/ssov2` and  `GET api/2.0/settings/authservice`.
